CertiKOS
=========================

## 1. Make the CertiKOS kernel

### Mac

To compile the kernel code, the following tools needs to be installed:

- i686-elf-binutils
- i686-elf-gcc

If the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh) is used, it is suggested to use the following script to install the above tools.
```
brew tap chrihop/gcc_cross_compilers
brew install i686-elf-binutils i686-elf-gcc
```

In addition, for the requirement of debugging the kernel, a cross-compiler version of `gdb` is also provided:

```
brew install i686-elf-gdb
```

## 2. Build QEMU (Raw) disk image

After the tools are successfully installed, please try:
```
make
```
to compile the kernel, and build the disk image.

## 3. Debug the code

### QEMU

Use command `make qemu` to launch the QEMU virtual machine, and start the CertiKOS OS.

To debug the kernel, use command `make qemu-gdb` to launch QEMU, and then `make gdb` to start gdb for current machine architecture in another terminal tab ('CMD + T').
